### Field Report: The Design Frontline

**Status:** Demoralized, but with excellent typography

The landscape is hostile. Posts like "10 Things Every UX Designer Must Know" multiply like mushrooms after the rain. Recruiters are searching for "design ninjas" skilled in branding, UX, UI, illustration, motion graphics, frontend development, latte art, astronauts, and —if possible— popes.

Meanwhile, over on TikTok, a self-proclaimed entrepreneur guru is aggressively dancing while declaring that "graphic design is dead" because "AI does everything now." Never mind that their logo looks like a 2003 WordArt experiment gone wrong. **The battle for design credibility rages on.**

**LinkedIn is enemy territory.**

It requires camouflage: professional headshots, inflated job titles, and writing in the third person to sound important.

But in the shadows, in Slack threads and Figma files, designers hold the line. They fight against vague briefs, against clients who say, "Make it pop, but subtly," and against the absurd insistence that every single project must include Instagram carousels "because the algorithm rewards it." And just when all seems lost when AI threatens to replace us, someone types "modern but classic" into Midjourney, only to receive a typographic abomination that looks like it escaped from a toilet.
Because the problem was never the tool. The problem is that they don't know what they want—until they see it. And that's where I come in.

I'm not a wizard. I'm not a ninja. I'm not "passionate about design" because that phrase means nothing anymore. I'm someone who understands how things work—and makes them work better. Whether it's a logo, an app, or a concept you didn't even know you needed until you saw it finished.

So, if you've made it this far, I'm probably saving you from a battle you don't even know you're about to fight.

**But don't worry—I've already got it handled.**
