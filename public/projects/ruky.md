## Project Overview

Ruky is a digital platform that helps young people in vulnerable economic situations access training and secure their first employment opportunities.
The system centralizes progress tracking, job applications, and training materials in one place — making the transition into the workforce more accessible, guided, and motivating.

> **The main goal**: turn a typically stressful job-seeking process into a supportive and engaging journey.

---

## Context

Fundación Forge is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping young people finish high school and develop skills to access their first formal job.

The platform needed to:

- Guide young users through training programs
- Help them track progress and visualize achievements
- Support job search and applications
- Provide mentorship and guidance throughout the process

## Challenge

We had **only 4 months** to design the entire experience, from concept to ready-to-hand-off prototype.

Challenges included:

- Designing the product while the business requirements were still being defined
- Presenting aesthetics early because the organization wanted to visualize “the final result”
- Defining features and flows developers needed to start building early
- Coordinating data needs with another internal team to know what could be displayed and from where

I had to balance **business expectations**, **technical constraints**, and **an immature product definition** — while keeping the design inspiring, coherent, and user-centered.

## Research & Insights

### Key insights:

- Users feel overwhelmed and insecure during first employment searches → the platform must be **warm and motivational**.
- They need guidance more than autonomy → design should **lead the way**, not expose options.
- The journey should feel **fun, social, and rewarding** — not like a bureaucratic system.

## Design Approach

### Storytelling as the core strategy

We built the experience around a metaphor:

> _Users are travelers starting a journey._

They are accompanied by **Ruky**, a mascot-guide who supports them, celebrates progress, and helps when they feel lost.

This creates emotional safety:

- A friendly companion instead of a cold system
- Clear step-by-step guidance
- Playful and motivating tone

### Visual Language

- Inspired by **travel, adventure, discovery, progression**
- Colors based on **sunrise/sunset gradients** to transmit optimism
- Rounded shapes inspired by travel stamps, boarding passes, luggage tags

## Key Priorities

- Reduce anxiety when interacting with the platform
- Make progress always visible
- Reinforce engagement through feedback and gamification
- Make data simple, direct, and actionable

## Solution

### Gamification

We incorporated mechanics like:

- Progress bars
- Leaderboards
- Route/map visual metaphor
- Achievements & rewards
- Immediate visual feedback

→ Not about “playing a game”, but about **creating motivation and a sense of belonging**.

### Character-driven guidance

Ruky, the mascot:

- Appears in moments where users might feel stuck
- Gives small nudges (continue / celebrate / next step)
- Creates an emotional connection

> _Design for confidence, not only usability._

## Results & Learnings

- The platform’s visual identity became the **reference for the future brand identity**
- The storytelling approach was adopted across communications
- The prototype enabled the team to secure internal approval and move development forward

### Key learnings

- Sometimes design requires leading the strategy when business is still unclear
- Storytelling is not decoration — it shapes how users feel inside a product
- Constraints can be creative fuel: _“done well and on time” beats “perfect but late”_
