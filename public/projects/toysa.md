## Project Overview

This project focused on the **redesign and improvement of the user experience** in Toysa’s e-commerce site, specifically the process of **requesting price quotes** for a wide range of products.
The main goal was to simplify navigation, clarify the purpose of the platform, and reduce friction in the quote request flow.

---

## Context

Toysa offers a large catalog of products where customers **request price quotes** instead of purchasing directly online.
The site had usability and clarity issues, which negatively impacted both new and experienced users.

---

## Challenge

- Make it clear that the site’s main purpose is **requesting quotes, not direct purchases**
- Improve **product search** and **filter navigation**
- Reduce **cognitive load** caused by repetition and excessive scrolling
- Provide a **logical and scalable hierarchy** across all sections

---

## Research & Insights

I conducted a **heuristic evaluation** using **Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics** to identify usability issues across the platform.

### Key Insights:

- **Products section** was the most problematic area:
  - Filters had too many items → slowed down navigation
  - Categories lacked clarity → difficult to scan simultaneously
  - Product variations appeared repetitively → cluttered searches
  - Long vertical format → excessive scrolling
  - No clear entry point for new users requesting quotes

- **Entire site**:
  - Buttons/texts were inconsistent, out of scale, and often truncated
  - Lack of clear hierarchy between elements
  - No guidance for first-time visitors

- **From heuristics analysis**:
  - Missing **loading indicators** (visibility of system status)
  - Technical terms not familiar to new users (match with real world)
  - Long paths required for basic actions (user control & freedom)
  - Inconsistent button hierarchy (consistency & standards)
  - No undo actions for order changes (error prevention)
  - Overloaded with repetitive information (minimalist design)
  - No FAQs or help section (help & documentation)

👉 After discussing with the company, we prioritized **improvements in the products section** since it was the core of the user flow.

## 🛠 Design Approach

The redesign aimed to simplify the experience and reduce friction points, while ensuring scalability for the catalog.

### Key Priorities:

- **Redesign the roadmap** for quote requests → fewer clicks & screens
- **Component revamp** → improved visual hierarchy and clarity
- **Simplify product grid & filters** → reduce repetition and noise
- **Clear entry point** for new users → smoother onboarding
- Emphasize the term **“PRESUPUESTO” (quote)** across flows
- **Cleaner UI** → reduce information overload, improve readability

## Results & Learnings

- Improved **efficiency** in requesting quotes → faster navigation and fewer steps
- Better **clarity of primary actions** → reduced user confusion
- A more **scalable and structured design system** for future iterations
- Key learning: **even in B2B contexts, clarity and minimalism drive adoption**
