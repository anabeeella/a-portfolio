## Project Overview

Aldea Explorer is a **blockchain explorer** designed to allow users to search, access, and understand data about transactions and blocks within the **Aldea blockchain ecosystem**.
The project focused on making highly technical information **usable, clear, and accessible**, while highlighting the unique value of Aldea compared to other blockchains.

---

## Context

Aldea’s target users are **technically knowledgeable**: developers, blockchain enthusiasts, and researchers. They expect powerful tools to search for **transactions, blocks, and wallet activity**, while also being able to explore **how data is structured and linked within the blockchain**.

However, despite this technical audience, the explorer also needed to support **transparency and accountability**, offering data in a way that could be easily navigated without unnecessary friction.

---

## Challenge

- Provide **fast and accurate search functionality** for transactions, wallets, and blocks
- Present **historical data** in a way that supports transparency and analysis
- Ensure clarity of **transaction details**: sender, recipient, amount, fees, and timestamps
- Balance **technical depth** with **usability** for non-expert stakeholders
- Differentiate Aldea Explorer from other blockchain explorers by **showcasing unique datasets**

---

## Research & Insights

Through interviews with blockchain users and heuristic analysis, I identified several areas of improvement:

### Key Insights:

- **Search functionality** was the primary expectation → needed to be fast, precise, and flexible
- **Data overload** risked overwhelming users without strong hierarchy
- **Block and transaction details** required clearer visual patterns for scanning
- **Historical transparency** was a strategic advantage → but presentation needed simplification
- **Packages & development tools** (classes, functions) could be showcased as part of the explorer, but required careful integration

From a **heuristics perspective**:

- Lack of **visibility of system status** (e.g., loading indicators)
- Inconsistent use of terminology → not all terms familiar for new users
- Hierarchy of actions unclear → especially primary vs secondary actions
- Minimal guidance for error recovery or documentation

---

## Design Approach

The design process focused on creating a **clean, minimal interface** that prioritized core actions (search & explore), while layering additional technical information for advanced users.

### Key Priorities:

- **Powerful search functionality** → by transaction ID, wallet address, or block hash
- **Clear navigation hierarchy** → transactions, blocks, packages
- **Historical data access** → designed as an easy-to-browse archive
- **Transaction detail views** → sender, recipient, fees, timestamps
- **Integration of packages** → reusable classes & functions accessible from the explorer
- **Minimalist data visualization** → emphasis on readability and scan-friendly layouts

---

## Results & Learnings

- Delivered a **functional, transparent, and user-friendly explorer** that balanced technical depth with usability
- Enabled developers to **explore Aldea blockchain data efficiently**, while also providing **accessible transparency** for broader audiences
- Key learning: **clarity and hierarchy are critical** in blockchain products, where data complexity can quickly overwhelm users
