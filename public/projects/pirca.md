## 🗂 Project Overview

Redesigned Pirca Solutions’ website, creating a cohesive and expressive **brand identity**, designing custom illustrations, and developing the full front-end implementation. The goal was to capture the essence of “finding the way,” inspired by the meaning behind "Pirca," and to deliver a standout online presence that feels intentional and human.

---

## 🌍 Context

The previous site failed to communicate Pirca’s personality—it was visually “neutral,” with little identity or emotional resonance. As a company rooted in guiding clients through technological pathways, Pirca needed a site that not only informed but also **evoked connection and guidance**, by translating the symbolism of "pircas" (stone stacks marking paths) into digital expression

---

## 🎯 Challenge

- Establish and reflect a **unique visual identity** that evokes Pirca's philosophy of guiding paths.
- Design illustrations and visual language from scratch, building a visual system coherent with the brand.
- Implement the design in a fully functional, optimized website, independently managing both design and frontend development.
- Ensure the new site communicates Pirca’s services—design, development, CloudOps, consulting—with clarity and personality.

## 🔎 Research & Insights

- “Pirca” refers to stacked stones used by ancient Andean peoples to mark trails and guide travelers. This concept became the **narrative backbone** of the project.
- A strong identity must go beyond logos—consistent visual cues, tone, and storytelling convey meaning and emotional presence.
- Designing personas and user journeys helped define where and how illustrations, tone, and interactive elements could reflect that sense of guidance.

### Key Insights:

- The website needed to feel **directional**: like it “leads” the visitor through content, not just displays it.
- Visual consistency across illustrations, layout, and interface creates trust and recognition.
- When storytelling is subtle and metaphorical (pircas guiding travelers), it builds a richer, more memorable brand feeling.

## 🛠 Design Approach

I combined **brand strategy, illustration, and front-end development** to transform Pirca’s website as an expressive, functional platform:

### Key Priorities:

- **Visual Narrative:** Develop illustrations and brand motifs based on stone stacks (“pircas”), subtly integrated into the layout.
- **Consistent Brand Language:** Define colors, typography, and UI components that resonate with the “guidance” metaphor.
- **Front-End Build:** Code the responsive website from scratch, ensuring fast load times and maintainable architecture.
- **Service Clarity:** Highlight Pirca’s offerings—Design, Developing, CloudOps, Consulting—as clear, illustrated service blocks.
- **Storytelling Flow:** Layer narrative—"infinite devices, one experience"—with visuals that feel human and aspirational.
