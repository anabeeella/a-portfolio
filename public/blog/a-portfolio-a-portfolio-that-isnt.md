## This is the first complex project I've done entirely on my own and pushed to production. While I've worked solo on many things and taken on tasks outside my scope as a designer or UX designer, this one —beyond being highly motivating— challenged me in new and unexpected ways.

### First of all, I'm not a full-stack developer. Not even front-end.  


I've built several sites using plain HTML and CSS, and a bit of JavaScript —just enough to add interactions, thanks to what I learned from platforms like [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), online courses, YouTube, and random coding challenges. I also contributed to dev teams here and there, adjusting tokens or variables, and trying not to annoy developers too much with "that's 1px off" or "that font is misaligned." (Which, now that I think about it, may be one of the reasons I started learning to code.)

My initial goal was simple: **build a cool portfolio.** 
But along the way, it turned into something much bigger. From "a nice site to show my work" to "I need to build a backend to manage content dynamically", this process became a space for technical, professional, and personal reflection. 

In the end, I didn't want to build *just* a portfolio —and I pushed it so far, it almost stopped being one. That's where the name came from: **A-Portfolio. No-Portfolio. A portfolio that isn't.** It all started with a bit of a Lisa Simpson vibes:

There was a need to create something. **Always creating.** I like making entertaining things and I like having fun and learning while I do it.  I'd wanted to do a project like this for a long time.

After years of jumping from project to project, and two years at a startup that lost funding, I found myself saying: *"Okay. I'll build a portfolio. I need to find a job."*    So I dug through all the projects I had done and contributed to, trying to pick the most relevant ones —the kind recruiters might want to see. I made a list. Created tons of images for Behance.  Wrote out my processes. Tried to understand what I had done, what I do, and what I want to do.

The next six months were tough. The market was oversaturated. Thousands of listings for designers. Millions of candidates. Math wasn't mathing. I went through interviews, got ridiculous offers (under $10/hour), and saw an industry too competitive and not very rational.

    UNTIL I GOT HIRED!

Fue un desafío volver a las canchas de la rutina después de estar 6 meses en Sicilia... (Sí, justo estuve viviendo a pocas cuadras del mar tirreno). Volví a Argentina, a trabajar en relación de dependencia y a la presencialidad. Fui una luz porque hacía mucho que no HACÍA. Me hice muchos amigos. Trabajé mucho. Me distraje... 


    THE EXPERIENCE WAS ALL BUT GREAT.

Hice lo que una buena compañera de trabajo puede hacer: I left a review on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com). En pocas y nobles palabras: Fue another company that *thinks* it wants a designer, but has no idea what designing really means, solo lo que el jefecito quiere. 

    SO I QUIT!

And suddenly that old urge came back: **MAKE SOMETHING COOL!**

 I revisited all my work, looked at the tools I had used, the experience I had gained and I realized I have *a ton* of tools. With a couple of AI assistants, even more. Pero no una IA que me resuelva o piense por mí, no (ya hablaremos de esto en otros posts, tengo mucho para expresar y compartir). No me gustan los atajos pero me gustan muchísimo las herramientas de todo tipo. Como para dimensionar, en mi último cumpleaños, mis amigas me regalaron pinzas, soldador de estaño y destornilladores QUE AHORA TENGO REPETIDOS. 
 
 En fin... Now comes the self-praise part: My therapist used to tell me that I had a lot of symbolic tools. Y creo que gran parte se lo debo a la curiosidad y a mi Universidad. En la carrera proyectual de comunicación visual (aka Diseño Gráfico) **we have learned to project, not just execute.**  That mindset is at the core of this whole thing y es la que sigue y seguirá vigente más allá de cualquier robot.

I knew what I wanted to build. I knew how I wanted to tell it. I knew how it should look, what content it should have, and what technical tools I'd need to get there. All grounded in the experience I've gained over the years —in the field, in startups, on teams, and alone.

So... This site is more than just a portfolio.  
It's a platform where I share my [projects](/projects), [thoughts and reflections](/blog), and useful [resources](/resources). I hope you find something that inspires you, makes you think differently, or helps you solve a challenge of your own. Feel free to explore, read, interact. And if something resonates with you — welcome to the conversation.
